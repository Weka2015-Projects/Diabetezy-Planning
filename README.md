# Diabetezy-Planning

Planning
========

Project Description
-------------------

Diabetezy is an app designed to help Diabetics keep track of their blood sugar levels throughout the day, and enable them to establish any patterns of sugar lows and spikes in order to correct their insulin doses.

The app will use Firebase to store user data such as times to test and their blood test scores. This interacts with a front end that allows users to amend their records, and also render a graph to visualise any fluctuation in these levels throughout the day.

A desktop version of the app will be created, and we aim to ultimately create an app for Android devices built in cordova.
